# Well Defined Class

A well defined class consists of the following:
- Instance variables
- Methods:
  - setters and getters methods
  - perform actions and return values methods
- Constructors: no-argument, argument, copy

Good practice is to also include _toString()_, and _equals()_ methods in your class.
